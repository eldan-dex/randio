TODO:
- test items and tweak properties

- shapes bg is retarded - fix or remove entirely

- NPCs group at the end of the level - why?

- entities can push each other away (and bug each other through walls)

- tweak target picking algorithm?

- entity fill as type indicator (boss has black slant lines, etc.)

- improve AI

- add backgrounds

- improve block textures

- Refactoring

ISSUES:
- Entities clip/bug through blocks and themselves
- Tile texture size might be too big for the engine to handle and it thus crashes (happens only once in a while) <- temporarily fixed by limiting max newTileSize to 4096
-> opticky prodlouzit tile polozenim 1-3 podobnych (stejny type) vedle sebe

IDEAS:
- keep the bug where player can get a quest to kill themselves as a feature
- switch all entities to the global coordination model
