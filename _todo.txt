TODO:
- Camera movement

ISSUES:
- Player falls down through the 0th block of every next tile

- Tile texture size might be too big for the engine to handle and it thus crashes (happens only once in a while)

IDEAS:
- Tile blending - for each tile, blend it's edges into surrounding tiles' textures -> keeps tile textures spearated, but blended
- Doublejumping?
- Consider reworking collision detection to support non-rectangular object shapes
