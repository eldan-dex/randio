TODO:
- Splotches - from rectangles
- Terrain collisions - check next tile edges
- Terrain collisions - continue fixing collisions of entities with nonstandard size
- Create a whole-splotch (splotch-over-splotch) background (even splotching darker versions of the same colour inside other splotches might work...

- Background textures
	- Colour splashes (monocolor, or fading towards the edges)
	- Shapes on a dark/light background (or faded out splashes)
	- L-Systems (pixelated, darker outlines)

- Improve basic AI
- Player interaction (attack, etc)

- Block generation algorithm POC
- Foreground texture generation algorithm POC

ISSUES:
- Entities clip/bug through blocks and themselves
- "Ghost" entities - invisible but impassable areas on the map - wtf are they?
- Player falls down through the 0th block of every next tile
- Tile texture size might be too big for the engine to handle and it thus crashes (happens only once in a while) <- temporarily fixed by limiting max newTileSize to 4096

IDEAS:
- Doublejumping?

CO S TÍM?
- futuristicky (konvenčně)
- abstraktně (wtf)
