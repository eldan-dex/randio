TODO:
- Improve basic AI
- Player interaction (attack, etc)

- Block generation algorithm POC
- Foreground texture generation algorithm POC
- Background texture generation algorithm POC

ISSUES:
- NPCs sometimes don't show at all (?!)

- Player falls down through the 0th block of every next tile
- Tile texture size might be too big for the engine to handle and it thus crashes (happens only once in a while) <- temporarily fixed by limiting max newTileSize to 4096

IDEAS:
- Tile blending - for each tile, blend it's edges into surrounding tiles' textures -> keeps tile textures spearated, but blended
- Doublejumping?
- Consider reworking collision detection to support non-rectangular object shapes
