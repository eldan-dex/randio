TODO:
- better unique item naming to distinguish between items for "bring" quests

- finish tweaking NPC movement

- NPCs group at the end of the level - why?

- entities can push each other away (and bug each other through walls)

- entity fill as type indicator (boss has black slant lines, etc.)

- improve AI

- add backgrounds

- improve block textures

- Refactoring

ISSUES:
- Entities clip/bug through blocks and themselves

IDEAS:
- show HP and stats (+ held item properties?)
- keep the bug where player can get a quest to kill themselves as a feature
- switch all entities to the global coordination model
