TODO:
- one square at the beginning of the map, which, when entered, will end the game and display results (with a prompt!)

- result counting (enemies killed, damage taken, time played, etc.)


- intro/outro manager - implement switching intro-game and game-outro

- intro as a "demo" map for testing the controls - force the player to move in all directions, kill a npc, etc. before letting him go
  do this only once when program is started, afterwards only restart the game, maybe with a different generated introtext

- improve quests

- entities can push each other away (and bug each other through walls)

- tweak target picking algorithm

- entity fill as type indicator (boss has black slant lines, etc.)

- improve AI

- add backgrounds

- improve block textures


- Refactoring

ISSUES:
- Entities clip/bug through blocks and themselves
- Tile texture size might be too big for the engine to handle and it thus crashes (happens only once in a while) <- temporarily fixed by limiting max newTileSize to 4096
-> opticky prodlouzit tile polozenim 1-3 podobnych (stejny type) vedle sebe

IDEAS:
- keep the bug where player can get a quest to kill themselves as a feature
- switch all entities to the global coordination model

QUESTS:
1. hrac musi presne vedet co se po nem chce
2. TYP - zabit oznacena NPCKA
3. TYP - najit a donest item
4. TYP - dostat se nekam nahoru?
5. TYP - zavod?

CO S TÍM?
- futuristicky (konvenčně)
- abstraktně (wtf)
