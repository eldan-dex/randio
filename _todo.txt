TODO:
- cannot turn when blocked by npc

- Terrain collisions - fix "skip" when going right on a new tile
- entities can push each other away (and bug each other through walls)

- entity outline color as HP indicator
- entity fill as type indicator (boss has black slant lines, etc.)

- Splotches - from rectangles
- Create a whole-splotch (splotch-over-splotch) background (even splotching darker versions of the same colour inside other splotches might work...
- Background textures
	- Colour splashes (monocolor, or fading towards the edges)
	- Shapes on a dark/light background (or faded out splashes)
	- L-Systems (pixelated, darker outlines)

- Improve basic AI

- Block generation algorithm POC
- Foreground texture generation algorithm POC

- Basic gameplay:
	- quest list
	- quest generation algorithm
	- quest completion checking

- Refactoring

- Timed events/animations

ISSUES:
- Tearing when moving camera along with player
- Entities clip/bug through blocks and themselves
- "Ghost" entities - invisible but impassable areas on the map - wtf are they? and why are they sometimes fixed and sometimes not?
- Tile texture size might be too big for the engine to handle and it thus crashes (happens only once in a while) <- temporarily fixed by limiting max newTileSize to 4096
- StackOverflow when player goes too far - why??

IDEAS:
- switch all entities to the global coordination model
