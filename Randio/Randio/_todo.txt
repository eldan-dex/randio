ISSUES:
- Background.MergeTiles cannot accept BG widths over 3840, but background needs to be wider.
	^ I'm dumb. It will have to be rendered piece by piece, it's a nonsense to try and hold a 20kpx wide image in memory.


TODO:
- Add textwirter
- Actually implement texture generation


IDEAS:
- Tile blending - for each tile, blend it's edges into surrounding tiles' textures -> keeps tile textures spearated, but blended
